# King Count - House Pricing Insights


## Overview

This project analyzes housing prices and features in King County for real estate agencies to see which feature has the strongest correlation with price. This project's recommendations will inform real estate agencies on which housing features to focus on when they are seeking to invest in King County Properties.


## Business Problem

There has been an increased competition between real estate agencies in King County due to the influx of professionals within the tech industry. As this trends continues, it becomes more important for real estate agencies to strategically invest in properties with the right housing features to get the best selling price. 

-----(to delete)
It is up to you to define a stakeholder and business problem appropriate to this dataset.

If you are struggling to define a stakeholder, we recommend you complete a project for a real estate agency that helps homeowners buy and/or sell homes. A business problem you could focus on for this stakeholder is the need to provide advice to homeowners about how home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes, and by what amount.

### The Data

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset which contains the house sale records from 2014 to 2015. Each sale record contains the selling price and housing features at the point of sale. 


### Method

For our approach, We followed the CRISP-DM standard process for Data Analysis as a guideline.

## Deliverables

There are three deliverables for this project:

* A **GitHub repository**
* A **Jupyter Notebook**
* A **non-technical presentation**

Review the "Project Submission & Review" page in the "Milestones Instructions" topic for instructions on creating and submitting your deliverables. Refer to the rubric associated with this assignment for specifications describing high-quality deliverables.

### Key Points

## Recommendations

### Future Analysis

### Repository Structure


* **Your deliverables should explicitly address each step of the data science process.** Refer to [the Data Science Process lesson](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-data-science-processes) from Topic 19 for more information about process models you can use.

* **Your Jupyter Notebook should demonstrate an iterative approach to modeling.** This means that you begin with a basic model, evaluate it, and then provide justification for and proceed to a new model. After you finish refining your models, you should provide 1-3 paragraphs discussing your final model - this should include interpreting at least 3 important parameter estimates or statistics.

* **Based on the results of your models, your notebook and presentation should discuss at least two features that have strong relationships with housing prices.**

## Getting Started

Start on this project by forking and cloning [this project repository](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-2-project) to get a local copy of the dataset.

We recommend structuring your project repository similar to the structure in [the Phase 1 Project Template](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-template). You can do this either by creating a new fork of that repository to work in or by building a new repository from scratch that mimics that structure.

## Project Submission and Review

Review the "Project Submission & Review" page in the "Milestones Instructions" topic to learn how to submit your project and how it will be reviewed. Your project must pass review for you to progress to the next Phase.

## Summary

This project will give you a valuable opportunity to develop your data science skills using real-world data. The end-of-phase projects are a critical part of the program because they give you a chance to bring together all the skills you've learned, apply them to realistic projects for a business stakeholder, practice communication skills, and get feedback to help you improve. You've got this!
